# Hubs-Intro

Hello and welcome to my brief resource page for Mozilla Hubs.

This will help you get started creating with Hubs - https://hubs.mozilla.com/  This has links to articles, demos and information of how to build on this platform.

Some examples:

Mozilla Hubs Demo Scene (heads up the stairs in the awesome theatre!) - https://hubs.mozilla.com/E4e8oLx/hubs-demo-promenade

- Desert Spaceport - https://hubs.mozilla.com/scenes/PJzj5Ds
- Train - https://hubs.mozilla.com/scenes/wUJgXWg/vtrainride
- Virtual Pub - https://hubs.mozilla.com/scenes/uJ4zmye

Key things to remember:

- Platform agnostic - you do not need a VR headset
- You can bring in live video feeds
- You can make a space your own
- Spatial audio is awesome!
